# Algorithm-Analysis-All-Hands-Project-Module-3

This repo is related to the **Algorithm All-Hands Projects** (AAHP) described within the [Algorithmology.org](https://algorithmology.org/) curriculum.

This is the third AAHP within the Spring 2025 cohort of Algorithmology at [Allegheny College](https://sites.allegheny.edu/computer-science/) (CMPSC 202-00) taught by [Dr. Gregory M Kapfhammer](https://github.com/gkapfham).

## Algorithm All-Hands Projects

These projects enable students to explore both the scientific and engineering aspects of algorithm analysis, as outlined in the course schedule. During the completion of a scientific study phase of algorithm analysis, students will work in a team to propose an original research question and design an experiment to answer it. When completing an engineering effort phase of algorithm analysis, students work in a team as they design, implement, document, test, and maintain software tools that support the rigorous evaluation of the performance (e.g., time or space overhead) of a Python program. The conclusion of an algorithm all-hands project involves the team-based creation, publication, and oral presentation of a report that overviews all of the experiences during the completion of the scientific study and engineering effort tasks for answering an original research question in the field of algorithm analysis. Students may use external sources, including artificial intelligence coding assistants, during the completion of an algorithm all-hands project provided that they cite these sources and explain how they used them to complete their part(s) of an algorithm all-hands project.

## Hash Table Configuration

During this module, our team is studying how hash table configurations (open addressing, chaining, hybrid) effect collision frequency and lookup time. This project is aimed to address the following **RQ**:

**RQ:** Compare hash table configurations (open addressing, chaining, hybrid) using a doubling experiment with randomly generated key-value pairs to analyze collision frequency and time overhead for lookups, including searches for both existing and non-existing keys.
